Android Project
===============

Currently, the set-up is easy, just clone the project with `git clone` and create a new branch with `git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>` to start coding a feature.
Follow the [thoughtbot git protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git) to write a feature and merge it to master after is approve by the leads.

## Developing

The project is written with Kotlin, which is now Google's official language for developing in Android. You can find the documentation at the [official site](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).

Is mandatory to use TDD when modifying **anything** from the app, this way we can ensure that every single feature is working correctly.
