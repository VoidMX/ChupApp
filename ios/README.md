# iOS Project
This is the iOS Version of the ChupApp.

## Developers
To start collaborating simple `git clone` this repository.

All collaborations will be submitted in Pull Requests. We use [Thoughtbot's Git Protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git). You need approval from an iOS admin and an Android developer to merge your branch into master, this helps ensure our code is efficient and understandable.

We use [Swift](https://swift.org/) as our primary language, although we may work with libraries written in Objective-C.

You should always test your code, specially until we find an automatic testing tool for Github (if you know of a Swift-Kotlin CI Tool please tell us!). There are two kinds of tests, UI Tests and Unit Tests, your features should be tested on both (if applicable).

Remember to **ALWAYS use ChupApp.xcworkspace instead of ChupApp.xcodeproj**, because CocoaPods require the .xcworkspace to work.

## Testers

To test the application you'll have to download the project.

1. Download [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/mx/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac AppStore. (Make sure you have the latest Mac OS to prevent any issues!)
2. **If you know git**, simply *clone* this repository in your computer (you can just `git pull` every time you're going to test)

    **If you don't know what git is** (you'll have to download the project every week)
    1. Go to the [repository main page](https://github.com/VoidMX/ChupApp)
    2. Click on the green button and select "Download ZIP"

    3. Once downloaded, double click it and a new folder should appear, click on it, go to the iOS folder, then to the ChupApp folder and then open *ChupApp.xcworkspace*. **DO NOT CLICK ChupApp.xcodeproj**, you won't break anything, but it might not work.
    4. Once the application launches, click the play button on the top ![Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/yh78FGf/Screen-Shot-2019-01-07-at-3-33-55-AM.png "Screenshot") Depending on your computer, **the application may take 1-5 minutes to launch.**
